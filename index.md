## Welcome to my GitHub page

I have linked [my repository](https://github.com/klh504/accessing-data-mysql) for you to view and will be discussing some of the content on this page.

I have worked to make this repository function and output information in JSON format. I will be making additional changes over the next few weeks to continually improve the functionality and aesthetics of the application.

### About the Application
- Springboot MVC was used to create this REST API which accesses data from a SQL database.
- The database is empty when the application is first created
- The controllers in the application contain functions to create, read, update, and delete items from the tables in the database. 
- Each controller corresponds to a different SQL table
- The data is sent by using CURL commands
- The data is output to the localhose URL in JSON format



### How the Application Works

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/klh504/Blog/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
